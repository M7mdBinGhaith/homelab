# Ansible Playbooks

A collection of Ansible playbooks designed to automate various tasks.

## Execution Context

These playbooks are specifically managed and executed via **Semaphore UI**:

* **Source:** Semaphore is configured to fetch playbooks directly from this repository.
* **Workflow:** The overall execution logic and task orchestration are defined within the Semaphore UI, not primarily within individual playbooks here.
